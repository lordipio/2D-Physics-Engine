# 2D-Physics-Engine

This is a simple C++ physics simulation project featuring a **particle system** with basic forces and soft body behavior. It's primarily a sandbox for experimenting with particle dynamics and physics forces like springs and drag.

> ⚠️ This project is currently under development. No releases or binaries are available yet.

## ✨ Features

- Particle-based simulation
- Spring force implementation (for soft body behavior)
- Fluid drag force (simulating fluid resistance)
- Real-time interaction (mouse clicks to spawn particles)
- Basic collision with screen bounds
- Simple rendering using SDL2 and SDL2_gfx
